We want our events to be a safe and inclusive environment. Thatâ€™s why we ask our attendees to follow our Code of Conduct!

In the unfortunate case that you see someone violating the code of conduct, here are some ways you can report it to us:

- Let an organizer know, either in person or via socials
- Send an email to Ash ([ash@kyd.com.au](mailto:ash@kyd.com.au))
