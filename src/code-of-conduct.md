## The Quick Version

At our meetup, we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. We ask that all attendees are mindful of their surroundings and of their fellow participants.

Meetup attendees violating these rules will be expelled from the meetup.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an organiser as soon as possible.

If you can't find the organiser, please [Report an Issue](/report/).

Meetup organisers are happy to help participants and assist people experiencing harassment by providing safe environment, arranging transport, accommodation or otherwise assist in the situation.

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues, online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
